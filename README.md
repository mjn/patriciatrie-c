Overview
========

An implementation of a Patricia Trie (also known as a radix tree/trie or compact prefix tree) which is a data structure used for storing large numbers of strings in a compact manner. It allows for the quick search/lookup of a string, and it can be used to check whether or not a prefix exists in the tree.
